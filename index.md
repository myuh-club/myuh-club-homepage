## Goals 
The main goal of this project is to use software engineering to create a platform of effective communication for the University of Hawaii's various extra curriculur activities. [There are over 200 RIOs (Registered Indepedent Organizations) affiliated with UH Manoa](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/studentlife/studentorg/rio.php), which can be overwhelming to students attempting to determine which clubs to join. If we are able to gather and present information about the RIOS on campus in a simple but effective manner, as this may increase a student's opportunity to find a RIO that matches their interests.

## Services 
- Provide a master list of all clubs
- Provide filters for users to search for clubs based on certain interests or majors
- feature the 5 most popular clubs on campus 
- allow users to add clubs they are interested in to their "cart"
- have options for users to send a request to organizers for more information on joining clubs
- allow club organizers to edit their club's information

## End Of Week 1 (Milestone 1 Progress)
Below are screen shots from our site that is being hosted by Galaxy. The group split up and covered different topis including an about us page, club and report pages, admin and organizer pages, and the search page which have all been added. Moving forward we are discussing issues and concerns each of us have with the functionality of certain pages.

<h5>Landing Page</h5>

Above is a screenshot of the landing page, which is the first thing you'd see when you load the site.

<h5>Landing Page</h5>

Above is a visual comparison of the difference in the navigation bar between signed in users and admins. As of this image the view report page and edit club page are still under maintenance. The navigation bar components are seen conditionally based on who is logged in. 
[Find our landing page here.][Find our landing page here.](http://myuhclub.meteorapp.com/#/) However, be advised that if the user is not logged in, they will not be able to see these components. Even when a user is logged in, the navigation bar will change based on what role that user has.

<h5>Dashboard</h5>

Above is the "Dashboard" page that will be used to direct users to the three main features for signed in user (favorites, search, and reports) and serve as a notification center as well.

## Rough Draft
Below are rough sketches the group composed during a brainstorming session. The group decided that the design philosophy of this project is going to be, 'simple is best.' One of our peripheral goals is to have a user interface that is simple, streamlined and functional. We hope that a new user will be able to intuitively use the site with little to no instruction.

<h5>Rough Sketch 1</h5>

Above we can see sketches from the first group meeting that envision the possible designs for the landing page.

<h5>Rough Sketch 2</h5>

Above is a bulleted list of components we wanted to have for the landing page. The group eventually agreed that the two boxes portrayed in the sketch currently will be implemented on two seperate pages. The top box will be the links for the landing page and the box on the bottom will be the basis of a registered user's homepage.
