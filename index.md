This is the homepage for MyUH Clubs, a beta site and project for ICS 314 in the spring 2019 semester. 

## Goals 
The main goal of this project is to use software engineering to create a platform of effective communication for the University of Hawaii's various extra curriculur activities. [There are over 200 RIOs (Registered Indepedent Organizations) affiliated with UH Manoa](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/studentlife/studentorg/rio.php), which can be overwhelming to students attempting to determine which clubs to join. If we are able to gather and present information about the RIOS on campus in a simple but effective manner, as this may increase a student's opportunity to find a RIO that matches their interests.

## Services 
- Provide a master list of all clubs
- Provide filters for users to search for clubs based on certain interests or majors
- feature the 5 most popular clubs on campus 
- allow users to add clubs they are interested in to their "cart"
- have options for users to send a request to organizers for more information on joining clubs
- allow club organizers to edit their club's information

## Page Ideas
Nick presented a sketch of his ideas so that he could better communicate his thoughts to the group. He sugested an approach similar to Google, (as shown below) but we could tailor the overall design to fit our specific needs, such as in his sketch. On the left hand side is a prototype sketch of how we could display the groups, which is similar to the card objects in Meteor.

Here we have Yusuke's sketches of the landing page and home pages.

Our reasons for picking these examples are because all of these sites are simplistic in design, which is a common trait that members of this group gravitate towards. One of our peripheral goals is to have a user interface that is simple, streamlined and functional. We hope that a new user will be able to intuitively use the site with little to no instruction.
