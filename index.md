The main goal of this project is to use software engineering to create a platform of effective communication for the University of Hawaii's various extra curriculur activities. [There are over 200 RIOs (Registered Indepedent Organizations) affiliated with UH Manoa](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/studentlife/studentorg/rio.php), which can be overwhelming to students attempting to determine which clubs to join. If we are able to gather and present information about the RIOS on campus in a simple but effective manner, as this may increase a student's opportunity to find a RIO that matches their interests.
This application should:
- Provide a master list of all clubs
- Provide filters for users to search for clubs based on certain interests or majors
- allow users to add clubs they are interested in to their favorites
- allow club organizers to edit their club's information
