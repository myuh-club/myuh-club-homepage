The main goal of this project is to use software engineering to create a platform of effective communication for the University of Hawaii's various extra curriculur activities. [There are over 200 RIOs (Registered Indepedent Organizations) affiliated with UH Manoa](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/studentlife/studentorg/rio.php), which can be overwhelming to students attempting to determine which clubs to join. If we are able to gather and present information about the RIOS on campus in a simple but effective manner, as this may increase a student's opportunity to find a RIO that matches their interests.
This application should:
- Provide a master list of all clubs
- Provide filters for users to search for clubs based on certain interests or majors
- allow users to add clubs they are interested in to their favorites
- allow club organizers to edit their club's information

## Community Feedback

The group conducted user testing for 6 individuals from various backgrounds.

Our testing process is as follows:
1. The person administering the test will have the participant watch the Basic User Guide video tutorial.
2. After watching the tutorial, administers will instruct participants to register an account and log in.
3. Administers will instruct participants to navigate to the pages available to them.
4. Administers will instruct the participants to utilize the Report a Problem Page to submit a report. The tasks were to register, log in, and to submit a report.
5. Administers instruct the participant to log out.
6. Lastly, the participants will fill out a Google form questionnaire pertainning to their experiences with the application. 

For the Google form, we asked the particpants a combination of closed and open ended questions in regards to the application.

Finally, the image above is one containing various user's feedback from the user survey. 
Based on the user testing, we can conclude that the participants found the site easy to navigate, after they had been given proper instructions. When this project began, ease of use and simplicity was the main goal for our team. Due to the responses from the user testing, it is safe to say we have achieved our main goal.
