MyUH Clubs

## Goals 
The main goal of this project is to use software engineering to create a platform of communication for the University of Hawaii's extra curriculur activities. [There are over 200 RIOs (Registered Indepedent Organizations) affiliated with UH Manoa](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/studentlife/studentorg/rio.php), which can be overwhelming to students attempting to determine which clubs to join.
## Services 
- Provide a master list of all clubs
- Provide filters for users to search for clubs based on certain interests or majors
- will feature the 5 most populus clubs on campus 
- will allow users to add clubs they are interested in to their "cart"
- will have options for users to send a request to organizers for more information on joining clubs
- will allow club organizers to edit their club's information

## Page Ideas
Nick presented a sketch of his ideas so that he could better communicate his thoughts to the group.

Nick suggested we try to make a landing similar to the Google Home page.

Another idea for the landing page could be a layout similar to Twitter's landing page.

For displaying the RIOS, we plan to use a format similar to card objects in meteor. We are also aiming to have a simple and functional interface that is similar to shopping such as the Warby Parker site.
