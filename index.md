## Goals 
The main goal of this project is to use software engineering to create a platform of effective communication for the University of Hawaii's various extra curriculur activities. [There are over 200 RIOs (Registered Indepedent Organizations) affiliated with UH Manoa](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/studentlife/studentorg/rio.php), which can be overwhelming to students attempting to determine which clubs to join. If we are able to gather and present information about the RIOS on campus in a simple but effective manner, as this may increase a student's opportunity to find a RIO that matches their interests.

## Services 
- Provide a master list of all clubs
- Provide filters for users to search for clubs based on certain interests or majors
- feature the 5 most popular clubs on campus 
- allow users to add clubs they are interested in to their "cart"
- have options for users to send a request to organizers for more information on joining clubs
- allow club organizers to edit their club's information

## Rough Draft
Below are rough sketches the group composed during a brainstorming session. The group decided that the design philosophy of this project is going to be, 'simple is best.' One of our peripheral goals is to have a user interface that is simple, streamlined and functional. We hope that a new user will be able to intuitively use the site with little to no instruction.

<h5>Rough Sketch 1</h5>

Above we can see sketches from the first group meeting that envision the possible designs for the landing page.

<h5>Rough Sketch 2</h5>

Above is a bulleted list of components we wanted to have for the landing page. The group eventually agreed that the two boxes portrayed in the sketch currently will be implemented on two seperate pages. The top box will be the links for the landing page and the box on the bottom will be the basis of a registered user's homepage.
