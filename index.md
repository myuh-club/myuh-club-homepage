This is the homepage for MyUH Clubs, a beta site and project for ICS 314 in the spring 2019 semester. 

## Goals 
The main goal of this project is to use software engineering to create a platform of effective communication for the University of Hawaii's various extra curriculur activities. [There are over 200 RIOs (Registered Indepedent Organizations) affiliated with UH Manoa](http://www.manoa.hawaii.edu/studentlife/studentorg/rio.php), which can be overwhelming to students attempting to determine which clubs to join. If we are able to present information about clubs in a simple but effective manner, this may increase a student's opportunity to find a RIO that matches their interests.

## Services 
- Provide a master list of all clubs
- Provide filters for users to search for clubs based on certain interests or majors
- feature the 5 most popular clubs on campus 
- allow users to add clubs they are interested in to their "cart"
- have options for users to send a request to organizers for more information on joining clubs
- allow club organizers to edit their club's information

## Page Ideas
Nick presented a sketch of his ideas so that he could better communicate his thoughts to the group.

Nick suggested we try to make a landing similar to the Google Home page.

Another idea for the landing page could be a layout similar to Twitter's landing page.

For displaying the RIOS, we plan to use a format similar to the contact card objects in meteor. We are also aiming to have a simple and functional interface that is similar to shopping such as the Warby Parker site. In place of the images for glasses, we could put an image or logo pertaining to that specific club. Instead of the style for the glasses, it could be the name of the club.

Our reasons for picking these examples are because all of these sites are simplistic in design, which is a common trait that members of the group gravitate towards. One of our peripheral goals is to have a user interface that is simple, streamlined and functional. We hope that a new user will be able to intuitively use the site with little to no instruction.
